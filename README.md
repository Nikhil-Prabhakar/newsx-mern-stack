# news-aggregator

This is a news aggregator application that collects news stories from multiple sources on various topics in real-time. It consists of a server component and a client component. It is built using the MERN-Stack.

In addition to MERN-Stack, this application leverages the NewsAPI, a popular news provider, to fetch the latest news articles from a wide range of sources. By incorporating NewsAPI, the news aggregator offers a comprehensive and up-to-date selection of news content to keep users informed and engaged.

## Usage

Once both the server and client are set up and running, you can access the news aggregator in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The client interface displays the latest news articles from various categories, and you can filter articles by category or view more details by clicking on an article.
